#  MBTI Personality Prediction using NLP

This project predicts MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality types from user-generated text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

-  Predicts the `MBTI type` of the user based on **three questions**.
-  Recommends **movies** and **books** for the user based on their types.

## ðŸ§ª Model Pipeline (For existing logistic regression)

1.  **Text Preprocessing**  
    - Converting to lowercase.
    - Removing URL, special characters.
    - **Lemmatization**
    - **Stopword removal**
    
2.  **Vectorization**  
    - Converting text into **TF-IDF(Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency)** features for numerical feature extraction.
    
3.  **Classification**  
    **Logistic regression** model of `scikit-learn`
    
4.  **Accuracy with Logistic regression**  
    - Oversampling: `91%`, with 84% on `MBTI 500` dataset.
    - Augmentation: `89%`
    - Using class weights: `67%`
    - Undersampling: `56%`

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- `Python` (`Flask`) for deploying the model. Hosted via **onrender**.
- `scikit-learn` for model building and accuracy analysis.
- `React` with `Javascript`, for building the frontend. Hosted via **Vercel**.
- `NodeJS` for Backend- authentication, fetching movies/books of particular types. Hosted via **onrender**.
- `MongoDB atlas` for database, storing user info and movies/books data.
